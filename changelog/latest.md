# ZetaBot v0.11.1-rc2

A small update with enhancements to bot behaviour, as well
as quality-of-life improvements for path authors.

Here's what's new:

* Bots can now activate cross lines (W1 and WR)!

* Pathnodes created will begin __at__ the player,
  instead of __in front of__.

* Some internal refactoring for the way pathnode
  types are plopped.
