# ZetaBot v0.11.2

A small but relatively important update with mostly pathing related changes.

Here's what's new since v0.11.1-rc2:

* More bot names!

* Pathing has been mildly reworked.

  * For `zb_debug >= 3`, when a path is found, it is displayed with blue
    arrows. Yep, the same ones that consist a mesh of `zt_showpaths`!

* Fixed nodelist handling.

* Added support for the Berserk Pack power-up to the bot handling of the fists.

* Made bots aim more erratically against 'fuzzy' foes (e.g. Spectres and
  partially invisible players and bots).

* Added `zb_autonodeuse`, to disable automatic Use node generation behaviour
  selectively.

* Tweaked some weapon situational desireability consideration code.
